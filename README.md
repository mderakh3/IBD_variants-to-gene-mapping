Hello
This code has been developed in R, and has different steps.

1. input_preparation
In this step, two fine-mapped GWAS datasets were integrated. At first, the loci were mapped to the human genome to see if there is an overlapp between signals from two cohorts. Then, after we found there was no overlapping signal and SNP in these datasets, they were pooled together for further analysis.

2. tf_binding_analysis


3. snATAC_seq_analysis


4. cicer_gene_prediction


5. HiC_gene_prediction


6. eQTL_gene_prediction


7. histone_modif_analysis
